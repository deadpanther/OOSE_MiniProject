# OOSE_MiniProject
OOSE Mini Project in TY.IT

This project was undertaken as a mini project for the OOSE Subject. We have created an e-commerce website for groceries and other essential daily products. The users can add the products to their cart and also modify them according to their needs and they can even confirm and checkout their order. They also get notified if their order is confirmed or not.
